Computing the bicharacter of diagonal harmonic polynomials
==========================================================

The main goal of this project  is to compute the character of diagonal
harmonic polynomials on $k$ rows of $n$ variables w.r.t. the action of
$GL_k$ and $S_n$. See `<DiagonalCharacter.ipynb>`_
for explanations, as well as those `slides <https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/nthiery/harmonic-modules/master?filepath=talk.ipynb>`_ of a talk on the topic (slow to start, but then you can play with the examples live!).

Dependencies: the `SageMath <http://sagemath.org>`_ open source mathematical system
