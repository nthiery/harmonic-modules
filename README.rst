Computing the bicharacter of diagonal harmonic polynomials
==========================================================

The main goal of this project  is to compute the character of diagonal
harmonic polynomials on $k$ rows of $n$ variables w.r.t. the action of
$GL_k$ and $S_n$. See [DiagonalCharacter.ipynb](DiagonalCharacter.ipynb)
for explanations.
